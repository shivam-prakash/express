### JSON
* JSON or javascript object notation is a very helpful tool which  helps in making API calls.
* This project makes use of a open source weather website and through its JSON makes a website where the user can enter any city's name and its minimum and maximum temo. would be displayed
* Before getting access to the weather website ,one needs to loginin through email and an appkey would be provided through the mail.
* The "request" method has been used to request for the JSON .
* AS the rendered file would be in string format so it is converted to json using JSON.parse() method.
